# MagicalGrid
Just for fun project -> practicing a few thing learned from Brian Voong, RW.com,  et al.

I worked through this project using a [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/endodoug/MagicalGrid/projects/1 "Magical Grid") and included a [Wiki](https://github.com/endodoug/MagicalGrid/wiki "Magical Grid Wiki") for additional notes, thoughts, etc...
